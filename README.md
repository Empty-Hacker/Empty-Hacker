# 💫 About Me:
🎓 Embarking on my 4th year of Information Technology, I view cybersecurity not just as a domain but as a manifesto. In a world rapidly turning digital, I passionately believe that cybersecurity is not just essential; it's an undeniable right. 🔐<br><br>My academic journey has provided me with a robust IT foundation, further fortified by certifications in Ethical Hacking, CISSP, and Cyber Security from SkillUP by Simplilearn. Yet, I go beyond books and certifications. I bring theories to life by cracking codes, engaging in ethical hacking, and continuously seeking to sharpen my skills. 🛡️💻<br><br>Venturing deep into cybersecurity simulations and workshops, I translate theoretical knowledge into tangible real-world applications. These endeavors reinforce a fundamental truth: in the grand tapestry of cybersecurity, evolution is the only constant. 🔄<br><br>Now, as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA), I stand at the intersection of academia and the expansive professional arena. I am not just seeking to learn; I'm actively pursuing synergies, collaborations, and opportunities to not only learn from the best but to innovate, inspire, and contribute to sculpting a fortress of digital security for our collective future. 🤝🌐
